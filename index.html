  <h1>Kanji Manuscript Annotation Project</h1>
  <p>This is a small experimental site exploring how kanji in historical Japanese texts can be annotated for meaning and reading.</p>

  <h2>Sample Kanji</h2>
  <p><strong>道</strong> — <em>michi</em> (road, way)</p>
  <p>Seen in travel texts like the <em>Tōkaidō</em> route. Appears in Edo-period manuscripts.</p>

  <h2>Image Example (Coming Soon)</h2>
  <p>I will upload an annotated image here shortly.</p>
